# COMP 250 Introduction to Computer Science Fall 2019
Algorithm designs coursework in Java at McGill University.

## **Project 1** - Construct Simple Civilization-inspired Strategy Game Using OOP
In this project, several classes ae written to build a very simplified version of a Civilization-inspired strategy game. By using the concepts from **OOP**, such as **super classes, override and overwrite**, this project is implemented in an efficient way.

## **Project 2** - MyBigInteger Class
In this project, we will work with arithmetic operations on large positive integers. Although Java has its own BigInteger class, we are going to build our own classes, namely MyBigInteger. The MyBigInteger class has two fields: base and coefficients. The base field is an int with values in {2, 3, â€¦, 10}. We could have allowed for larger bases but that would have required using special symbols for the numbers greater than 1. In this project, we focus on developing three functions, they are:

- **dividedBy** (part division)
- **convert** (base conversion)
- **primeFactors**

## **Project 3** - A Simple KD-Tree
In this project, a simple KD-Tree is implemented. The **constructor KDNode** is given an array of Datum objects, and it constructs a KDNode
object that is the root of a subtree whose leaves contain the given Datum objects. Furthermore, this project also focus on the **KD-TreeIterator** and **finding the nearest node**.

## **Project 4** - A Simple Search Engine
In this project, a simple search engine is implemented by using the **graph theroy** and **DFS**. This search engine is implemented to have the following features:
- Crawling and Indexing
- Ranking
- Searching
